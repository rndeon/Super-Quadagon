Super Quadagon
==========

A simple game for the Arduino + 8x8 LED display. I used it to get familiar with how to make those work together.

## Installation
Copy the contents of the 'libraries' folder into your Arduino installation's 'libraries' folder. This will be something like 'arduino-1.0.5/libraries'.
Then just open the .ino file in your Arduino IDE!

## Electronics
Check out the schematics at: https://upverter.com/KingstonMakerspace/e3012575a3353ac9/Super-Quadagon/ . I have not built the PCB yet, it's all on a breadboard right now.
